# Project Title

This week's challenge is to modify starter code to create a functional random password generator.  The first challenge was getting the button to work and that was one of the many challenges I had to solve. There was also some other challenges like creating prompt questions on how the user wants their password for example, character length of at least 8 or a max of 128 characters, lower case letters, upper case letters, or even numbers.

## Usage

To use the password generator:

Start by pressing the "Generate Password" button.
Next Answer the prompt questions.
Once completed randomly generated password would be made.
